### Languages
##### JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation).

A few things you definatelly need to know about JavaScript if you want to understand it in depth. It is:
* [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)
* [prototype-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming)
* [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language)
* with [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function)

programming language. Alongside with HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. 

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles.
Created by Netscape (today's Mozilla) engineers, there is no better place for documentation than the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) in Mozilla Developer Network.

### Frameworks
##### AngularJS v1
AngularJS is an MV* framework that is ideal for use when building client-side single-page apps. It is not a library, but a framework for building dynamic web pages. It focuses on extending HTML and providing dynamic data binding. Instead of manipulating the DOM “directly,” you annotate your DOM with metadata (directives), and Angular manipulates the DOM for you. Angular is ideal for single-page application ([SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) development.

Using dependency injection, Angular brings traditionally server-side services, such as view-dependent controllers, to client-side web applications. Consequently, much of the burden on the server can be reduced. Get in speed with AngularJS by starting with the links below:

### Tools
##### [Browser Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)
##### Kendo UI
Kendo UI® by Progress is an HTML5 user interface framework for building interactive and high-performance websites and applications. The framework comes with a library of 70+ UI widgets, an abundance of data-visualization gadgets, client-side data source, built-in MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) library. Kendo UI provides AngularJS and Bootstrap integration.

The [Kendo UI Book](http://codylindley.github.io/the-kendo-ui-book/) is useful to understand why may someone need to use Kendo and how it works
